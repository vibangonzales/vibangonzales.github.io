# General {.body}

## Scope {.body}

This document specifies the process used to produce open-source documents within
the field of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).

The process follows general practices within the larger open-source community;
however, this document:

- provides a step-by-step overview of the process, so that those unfamiliar with
open-source processes can better understand the process and become contributors,
- formalizes the process (e.g., by clearly defining what are requirements), and
- tailors the process (e.g., by defining the preferred tools to be used).

The process to approve the resultant product is defined elsewhere (e.g., NTCIP 8001).

The ITS Open-Source Process is based on the practices defined by
[open-sauced](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/tree/main). However, whereas
open-sauced is written as an informative guide and describes how systems can
work; this document is written as a specification to define how the ITS
Open-Source Process will work. While still providing a discussion of the
issues; it highlights the requirements and notable options along the way by
stating each in its own paragraph and boldfacing the keywords "shall" and "may"
to clearly designate requirements and options. The
remaining text provides further guidance and can include additional options
that do not necessitate specific numbering.

We recognize that onboarding to a new project can be challenging, especially if
you're new to open source development. Be patient, and don't be discouraged by
setbacks or mistakes. You'll become more comfortable and confident in your
contributions with persistence and practice.

## General Statements {.body}

The remainder of this document is broken into the following chapters:

- **Commenting Process:** Details the process of contributing to open-source
projects and provides step-by-step processes for using the preferred tools of
the ITS open-source projects.
- **Contribution Process:** Details the process of contributing to open-source
projects and provides step-by-step processes for using the preferred tools of
the ITS open-source projects.
- **Maintenance Process:** Details the rules that project maintainers are to
follow when managing an ITS open-source project. This includes processes for
setting up new projects, managing issues and pull requests, maintaining quality,
and coordinating with standard development organizations.
- **Approval Process:** Defines the approval stages for ITS open-source projects
and the processes required for approval for each stage and subsequent tagging
and publication of versions.[^move to 8001]
- **Documentation Conventions:** Annex B defines the preferred styles,
processes, and tools for developing documentation for ITS open-source projects,
including projects that are 100% documentation (e.g., the ITS Open-Source
Process project).
- **Code Conventions:** Annex C defines the styles, processes, and tools for
developing computer code for ITS open-source projects, including Python and ASN.1.
- **Requirements Management:** Defines preferred ways to use requirement
management tools to produce content that can be easily integrated into the ITS
open-source pojects while providing clear traceability.
